# RFM Customer Segmentation (E-commerce Retail)

## 1) Project Overview
### Objective

#### **📖 What is this project about?**

Build a customer segmentation workflow using the RFM (Recency–Frequency–Monetary) framework to classify SuperStore customers into meaningful groups (e.g., Champions, Loyal, At Risk…) and support targeted marketing campaigns for the Christmas & New Year season.

#### **🙋🏻‍♂️ Who is this project for?**

- **Marketing team:** design different campaign offers for each customer segment (loyalty, win-back, upsell).
- **Business stakeholders (Marketing Director):** prioritize budget and identify high-value customers.
- **Data/Analytics team:** provide a scalable segmentation pipeline (Python) instead of manual Excel classification.


#### **Business Context**

SuperStore is a global retail company with a large and growing customer base. During the holiday season, Marketing wants to:
- **Reward customers** who have supported the company,
- **Activate/push potential customers** to become loyal customers.

❗️ In previous years, segmentation could be done manually in Excel, but the dataset has grown too large. Therefore, the Analytics team is asked to implement an automated approach using python

#### **❓Business Questions**

- How can we segment customers based on purchasing behavior this year?
- Which segments should be prioritized for holiday campaigns (retention vs reactivation vs growth)?
- What actions/offer strategy shoukd Marketing apply for each segment?

### RFM Analysis Overview 

#### **Why use RFM?**

RFM is a practical and business-friendly model because it converts transaction history into three easy-to-explain signals:

- Recency (R): How recently a customer purchased
  - ➡️ identifies active vs inactive customers
  
- Frequency (F): How often a customer purchases
  - ➡️ identifies loyal / repeat buyers
  
- Monetary (M): How much a customer spends
  - ➡️ identifies high-value customers
